# Introduction to HTML

## Context

Last Module Challenge. The goal is to use all knowledge gathered so far to make a new CV and portfolio. Also, we need to show our capabilities when working collaboratively, so we have also asked to perform, at least, one commit per project from two different classmates, i.e., fork a project from two folks, make commits on those forks, and then make a pull request.
